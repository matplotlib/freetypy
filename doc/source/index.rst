freetypy documentation
======================

`freetypy` is a general-purpose Python wrapper to `FreeType
<http://www.freetype.org>`_ with a goal to be fast and flexible as
possible.

It is open source under the BSD license.

It is developed as part of the `matplotlib
<http://www.matplotlib.org>`_ project, though it is an independent
library that intends to be of general use outside of matplotlib as
well.
